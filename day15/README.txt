Beverage Bandits

I'm one of those who weren't too hindered by the possibility of stall
chiming up in part two.  On the other hand, I was put off as much as

really no natural reason why the character more NW than others would
have any kind of preemption.  So do away with it.  We've had serious
research on simultaneity since since Diplomacyâ„¢ came out.
