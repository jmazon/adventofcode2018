* adventofcode2018

Totally a habit.

A rough year for me, with a travel-ridden December, little free time,
and general health instability.  This may have made me a bit
oversensitive to the perceived unnatural imperativeness of a few
puzzles, which clashes with my idiomatic Haskell somewhat.  Please
take the grumpy comments in the specific days' READMEs with a grain of
salt.

Obviously, I was never up or available in a reasonable condition at
Aoc midnight, so no puzzle really exhibit any time pressure.  Some
(notably 21) were actually solved offline, and idle, as its timing
blatantly yells.

At any rate AoC remains in my view an extremely high-quality puzzle
compendium, and I know a thing or two about problem setting by now.

Thanks again @topaz and team!

** Personal code comments

I don't think there's anything particularly noteworthy in my
contribution this year.  Yet.

Day 1 does feature rather compact code.

Days 9, 14 and 17 definitely deserve another look as to algorithmic
complexity.  Possibly 11 and 22 as well.

All assembly-related puzzles are still expected to undergo factoring,
and if possibly better automation to streamline the
reverse-engineering a bit more.

Lastly, I'm still planning on pushing the knot-tying a bit further on
day 22, so as to get rid of the array altogether, only compute
locations that are needed by the search, and still not waste too much
memory.  Watch this space.  (Then there's the obvious transition from
Dijstra to A*, and for once birectional search is actually a good
fit!)

Branch raw is a merged dump of what I had on my computers after
reaching fifty stars; branch master (you're on it) is what I consider
presentation-worthy.  With variable standards.

[1] Nobody seems to agree whether Perl 5 is interpreted or compiled.
Well, my table only has two columns, so there.

[2] Run offline using a compiled Haskell interpreter of the patched
code.  So I'm classifying as interpreted (which the source code is),
as opposed to compiled, which would be if (when) I had it transpiled.
