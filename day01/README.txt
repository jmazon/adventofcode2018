Chronal Calibration

Those contend for the shortest solutions I've ever written for AoC.

For part 1, I simply evaluate it in bash arithmetic, prepending a 0
for good measure.  It might have ended up slightly shorter using bc,
but I failed to find a proper way to write it, so bash it is.

For part 2, I originally used bc, generating its input by `paste`-ing
an endless column of "last" (generated by `yes`) to the left with a
while-generated endless `cat` of the input to the right.  This worked,
but while cleaning up I wondered why not repeat the actual input file
as a whole with `yes`?  And then `paste` wasn't needed at all anymore,
a simple `sed` sufficed and code length won.

Part 1 is 14 characters long.
Part 2 is 50 characters long.
