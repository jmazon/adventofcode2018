Mode Maze

Part one was extremely straightforward.

My part two had the infamous “wrong right and down of target” bug,
since my maze implementation was a simple rock patch over the target's
region type, instead of a proper geological index patch that would
propagate.  I've attempted for the longest time to implement it
properly, failed, and passed the puzzle going the easy way out.

I haven't said my last word on this, though!
